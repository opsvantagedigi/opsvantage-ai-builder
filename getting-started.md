## Welcome to OpsVantage Digital

This guide will walk you through the entire process of creating and launching your first website using our AI-powered platform.

### Step 1: The Onboarding Wizard

The first step is to tell our AI about your business. Navigate to the "Get Started" page to begin the onboarding process. You'll be asked a series of questions about:

- **Your Business**: What is your business name and what industry are you in?
- **Your Brand**: What is your desired brand voice (e.g., professional, friendly, luxurious)?
- **Your Goals**: What is the primary goal of your website (e.g., generate leads, sell products)?

The more detail you provide, the better our AI can tailor the website to your specific needs.

### Step 2: AI Generation

Once you complete the wizard, our AI gets to work. In just a few moments, it will generate a complete, multi-page website based on your inputs. This includes a professional sitemap, SEO-optimized copy, and a cohesive design. You can watch the progress on the generation status page.

### Step 3: Customize in the Editor

After generation is complete, you'll be taken to our visual editor. Here you can reorder sections, edit text directly on the page, and change colors and fonts using the AI design assistant.

### Step 4: Go Live

When you're happy with your site, navigate to the **Settings** tab of your project. You can use the provided OpsVantage subdomain or add your own custom domain. Click **Publish**, and your site will be deployed to our global edge network. Congratulations!
